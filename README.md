Project theme: We as a team tried to build a project for the community of people who face it challenging to talk to people around them. This project focuses on 
the problem of communication which lots of people are facing. Being a person who is new to a society or a youth new to a college or a child on his first day of school 
at some point of time in our life we all have faced the problem of communication. We all are so busy in our life and work that we don’t have time to talk in person as 
a result of which many people lack communication ability. It’s not enough if people only learn technical skills , soft skills are equally important for communicating and 
collaborating effectively . So here we are with our project that will provide all the soft-skills required for better communication and the soft-skills which are important 
to live in the real world. We have included some activities that are based on real life scenarios which will help the learner to relate better and will improve their skills 
and understanding too.  
Our application name is ConFeTalk which is an acronym for Talk Fearlessly with Confidence. There are many other courses and applications on the same 
but they are either expensive or not for beginners. We are trying to make an application that is good for both beginners and advanced.
